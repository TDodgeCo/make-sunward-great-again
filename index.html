        Not a takedown. A record. How a legacy steel company drifted, why its people left, and what it would’ve taken
        to fix the thing instead of burying it under procedure and nostalgia.

      <h2>Context</h2>

      <h3>What this is</h3>
      <p>Legacy company. Modern friction. Inside analysis.</p>

      <p>
        Sunward started with Danton Wirth, a founder who left his fingerprints all over the pre-engineered metal
        building industry. In Colorado and beyond, he helped shape half a dozen competitors by training the people who
        would go on to lead them.
      </p>
      <p>
        After his passing, leadership transitioned to his daughter Amy Wirth and her husband Todd Silverman. I worked
        closely with both during my tenure. In my experience, they are decent people with earnest intent—but intent
        alone does not steer an organization through a shifting market.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>I was taught who to distrust before I was taught how things worked. In hindsight, that order speaks for itself.</p>
      </blockquote> 

      <p>
        This project is not about vilifying individuals. It is about examining systems, narratives, and how legacy
        identity can harden into defensive posture instead of adaptive leadership.

      <section id="preview-leadership-altitude">
        <h3>Preview: Leadership Altitude</h3>
        <p>
          In an early chapter, we’ll examine a subtle but defining influence on Sunward’s internal gravity:
          <strong>how far decision-making sat from daily conditions</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This isn’t an exposé and it isn’t personal. It’s simply the operational reality that the person at the top was
          frequently away from the rhythm of the place—travel, other commitments, stretches out of state. None of it
          scandalous, all of it consequential.
        </p>
        <p>
          When leadership engages the company mainly through summaries and end-of-week reports, normal friction reads as
          acceptable fluctuation. Quote delays feel procedural, not precarious. Backlog looks like volume success,
          rather than evaporating opportunity. Cultural strain registers as abstraction, not urgency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later, we’ll also look at the quieter problem beneath that distance:
          <strong>reporting fragmentation</strong>. At Sunward, there were easily a dozen different sources claiming to
          show “actualized revenue” for a given period. None of them agreed with one another, all of them were
          considered authoritative, and decisions were routinely made from whichever PDF or hard-banked export happened
          to be in the right inbox at the right moment. When the top isn’t aligned on which numbers represent reality,
          everyone downstream is left guessing at what they’re supposed to be reacting to, or why targets keep shifting.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’ll return to this not to point fingers, but to understand how
          <strong>altitude plus inconsistent instrumentation</strong> made response, planning, and accountability almost
          impossible to synchronize.

            <h3>Reconsidering the narrative</h3>
      <p>
        Six months before I arrived, two key members of leadership—Dave Maxe and Lisa Wirth, Amy's sister—departed to
        start their own company. Their names surfaced often, framed as defectors, antagonists, or disloyal
        opportunists.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first, I accepted that characterization without question. With time, exposure, and direct operational
        experience, that framing began to break down. People rarely abandon comfortable, well-compensated positions
        tied to a legacy brand to shoulder the financial and operational burden of building from zero—unless the
        internal climate renders staying untenable.
      </p>
      <p>What became clear is that I had inherited a story rather than a full picture. Loyalty was narrated. Context was not.</p>

      <section id="where-i-got-it-wrong">
      <h3>Where I got it wrong</h3>
      <p>
        I participated in the inherited narrative. I allowed myself to adopt others' grievances as my own. This memoir
        will include that: not as confession, but as context for growth. The aim is not retribution—it is clarity.

        I am writing a plain-language account of what I witnessed: the internal bottlenecks, inherited legacies,
        narratives that shaped loyalty, and the quiet organizational forces that make good people leave and good
        intentions fail.
