                Sunward started with Danton Wirth, an ABSOLUTE LEGEND who left his fingerprints all over the pre-engineered metal
                building industry. In Colorado and beyond, he helped shape half a dozen competitors by training the people who
                would go on to lead them.
              </p>
              <p>
                After his passing, leadership transitioned to his daughter Amy Wirth and her husband Todd Silverman. I worked
                closely with both during my tenure. In my experience, they are decent people with earnest intent—but intent
                alone does not steer an organization through a shifting market.

                  I was taught who to distrust before I was taught how things worked. In hindsight, that order speaks for itself.

                This project is not about vilifying individuals. It is about examining systems, narratives, and how legacy
                identity can harden into defensive posture instead of adaptive leadership.

              </h3>

              <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
                In an early chapter, we’ll examine a subtle but defining influence on Sunward’s internal gravity:
                <strong class="font-semibold text-slate-100">how far decision-making sat from daily conditions</strong>.
              </p>

              <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
                This isn’t an exposé and it isn’t personal. It’s simply the operational reality that the person at the top was
                frequently away from the rhythm of the place—travel, other commitments, stretches out of state. None of it
                scandalous, all of it consequential.
              </p>

              <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
                When leadership engages the company mainly through summaries and end-of-week reports, normal friction reads as
                acceptable fluctuation. Quote delays feel procedural, not precarious. Backlog looks like volume success,
                rather than evaporating opportunity. Cultural strain registers as abstraction, not urgency.
              </p>

              <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
                Later, we’ll also look at the quieter problem beneath that distance:
                <strong class="font-semibold text-slate-100">reporting fragmentation</strong>. At Sunward, there were easily a dozen different sources claiming to
                show “actualized revenue” for a given period. None of them agreed with one another, all of them were
                considered authoritative, and decisions were routinely made from whichever PDF or hard-banked export happened
                to be in the right inbox at the right moment. When the top isn’t aligned on which numbers represent reality,
                everyone downstream is left guessing at what they’re supposed to be reacting to, or why targets keep shifting.
              </p>

              <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
                We’ll return to this not to point fingers, but to understand how
                <strong class="font-semibold text-slate-100">altitude plus inconsistent instrumentation</strong> made response, planning, and accountability almost
                impossible to synchronize.

                Reconsidering the narrative
              </h3>

              <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
                Six months before I arrived, two key team members —Dave Maxe and Lisa Wirth, (Amy's sister)—departed to
                start their own company. Their names surfaced often, framed as defectors, antagonists, or disloyal
                opportunists.
              </p>

              <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
                At first, I accepted that characterization without question. With time, exposure, and direct operational
                experience, that framing began to break down. People rarely abandon comfortable, well-compensated positions
                tied to a legacy brand to shoulder the financial and operational burden of building from zero—unless the
                internal climate renders staying untenable.
              </p>

              <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
                What became clear is that I had inherited a story rather than a full picture. Loyalty was narrated. Context was not.

              <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
                I participated in the inherited narrative. I allowed myself to adopt others' grievances as my own. This memoir
                will include that: not as confession, but as context for growth. The aim is not retribution—it is clarity.
