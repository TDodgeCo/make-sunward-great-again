      I showed up to build. Instead, I found a company run by spreadsheets, ghosts, and sacred processes nobody was allowed to question. This is the story.

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">What this is</h2>
          <p class="text-base text-gray-600">Legacy company. Modern friction. Inside analysis.</p>
        </header>

        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          Sunward started with <strong>Danton Wirth</strong>, a founder who left his fingerprints all over the pre-engineered metal building industry. In Colorado and beyond, he helped shape half a dozen competitors by training the people who would go on to lead them.
        </p>

        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          After his passing, leadership transitioned to his daughter <strong>Amy Wirth</strong> and her husband <strong>Todd Silverman</strong>. I worked closely with both during my tenure. In my experience, they are decent people with earnest intent—but intent alone does not steer an organization through a shifting market.
        </p>

        <div class="border-t border-gray-200"></div>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Reconsidering the narrative</h2>

        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          Six months before I arrived, two key members of leadership—<strong>Dave Maxe</strong> and <strong>Lisa Wirth</strong>, Amy's sister—departed to start their own company. Their names surfaced often, framed as defectors, antagonists, or disloyal opportunists.
        </p>

        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          At first, I accepted that characterization without question. With time, exposure, and direct operational experience, that framing began to break down. People rarely abandon comfortable, well-compensated positions tied to a legacy brand to shoulder the financial and operational burden of building from zero—unless the internal climate renders staying untenable.
        </p>

        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          What became clear is that I had inherited a story rather than a full picture. Loyalty was narrated. Context was not.
        </p>

        <blockquote class="border-l-2 border-emerald-500 pl-3 text-base text-gray-700">
          I was taught who to distrust before I was taught how things worked. In hindsight, that order speaks for itself.
        </blockquote>

        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          This project is not about vilifying individuals. It is about examining systems, narratives, and how legacy identity can harden into defensive posture instead of adaptive leadership.
        </p>

        <div class="border-t border-gray-200"></div>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Where I got it wrong</h2>

        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          I participated in the inherited narrative. I allowed myself to adopt others' grievances as my own. This memoir will include that: not as confession, but as context for growth. The aim is not retribution—it is clarity.
